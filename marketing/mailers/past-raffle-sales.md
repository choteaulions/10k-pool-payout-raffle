Dear Friend of the Choteau Lions Club,

For the past 31 years, our **Trip of the Month** raffle has been one of the cornerstones of our fundraising efforts—supporting not only the Choteau Lions Club Pool, but also countless community service projects and youth programs right here in Choteau. Thanks to supporters like you, we’ve been able to serve our community with heart, pride, and purpose.

Today, we’re writing with a mix of gratitude and change.

Due to shifts in the travel industry and challenges with prize vendors, we’ve made the tough decision to retire the Trip of the Month raffle. The current raffle will continue its monthly drawings through August 2025, and we’re incredibly thankful for the many years of enthusiastic support that made it such a success.

But as one chapter closes, another begins.

This summer, we’re proud to launch the **Choteau Lions $10 Grand Pool Payout**, a fresh and exciting way to support the work we do. This new raffle includes over $12,000 in prizes, culminating in a grand prize drawing for $10,000, to be held at the final “Get Your Kicks at 6” concert on **Thursday, August 14, 2025**.

Leading up to the big night, we’ll host two early bird drawings:

* **July 3:** Ninja BBQ 7-in-1 Grill & 50 lbs. of Montana beef
* **Early bird drawing 2:** CZ Redhead 20-Gauge Shotgun

Tickets go on sale **Memorial Day Weekend**, and as a valued past supporter, you are among the first to receive a set of tickets by mail.

**Ticket Pricing:**

* 1 ticket – $100
* 2 tickets – $150

Our goal is to net $40,000 to support the Choteau Pool and other community resources like the bandshell, skating rink, and tennis courts. Every ticket sold helps us keep these facilities running and continue our mission of service to Choteau.

Thank you—for your generosity, your belief in what we do, and your continued support of our community.

With sincere appreciation, \
Yours in Service,
